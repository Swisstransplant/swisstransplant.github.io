## What is EXAM?

EXAM is a dashboard for analyzing hypothermic machine perfusion data from the [ORS LifePort Kidney Transporter](https://www.organ-recovery.com/lifeport-kidney-transporter/). EXAM is free software written in the R programming language.

## Why is EXAM useful?

EXAM will enable transplant organizations to analyze their data, perform statistics, and conduct quality checks, allowing them to identify potential issues and optimize machine perfusion processes, ultimately benefiting kidney recipients.

## Who created EXAM?

EXAM was developed by [Swisstransplant](https://www.swisstransplant.org/)---the Swiss national foundation for organ donation and transplantation, in collaboration with three Swiss transplant centers.

::: {.callout-warning title="Important" collapse=false}
Hypothermic machine perfusion data alone should never be used as the sole basis to discard a kidney allograft.

## Dashboard

Here is the link to the [EXAM dashboard](https://swisstransplant.shinyapps.io/EXAM/). The EXAM source code is maintained on [GitHub](https://github.com/Swisstransplant/EXAM). For research purposes, LifePort data can be parsed and processed using the Swisstransplant R package named [`swt`](https://github.com/Swisstransplant/swt).
