## What is EXAM?

EXAM is a dashboard for analyzing hypothermic machine perfusion data from the [ORS LifePort Kidney Transporter](https://www.organ-recovery.com/lifeport-kidney-transporter/). EXAM is free software written in the R programming language.

## Why is EXAM useful?

EXAM will enable transplant organizations to analyze their data, perform statistics, and conduct quality checks, allowing them to identify potential issues and optimize machine perfusion processes, ultimately benefiting kidney recipients.

## Who created EXAM?

EXAM was developed by [Swisstransplant](https://www.swisstransplant.org/)---the Swiss national foundation for organ donation and transplantation, in collaboration with three Swiss transplant centers.

## Terms of use

By accessing or using this program, you agree to the terms of the [GNU Affero General Public License](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html) and the following supplements to its sections 15 and 16:

* You are solely responsible for evaluating the program’s functionality, suitability, and safety before use.

::: {.callout-important appearance="simple" collapse=false}
Hypothermic machine perfusion data should not be used as a basis for discarding a kidney allograft. 

Please refrain from uploading personal, sensitive, or patient-identifiable data. All uploaded data is temporary and will be automatically deleted at the end of the session. The developers assume no liability for any misuse of the application or the data provided by users.

## Dashboard

Here is the link to the [EXAM dashboard](https://swisstransplant.shinyapps.io/EXAM/). The EXAM source code is maintained on [GitHub](https://github.com/Swisstransplant/EXAM).

## Research and data analysis

For research purposes, LifePort data can be loaded and analyzed using the Swisstransplant R package [`swt`](https://github.com/Swisstransplant/swt). A showcase is provided here <https://data.swisstransplant.org/lifeport/>.
