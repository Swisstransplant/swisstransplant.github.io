## What is EXAM?

EXAM is an dashboard for analyzing hypothermic machine perfusion data in deceased-donor kidney transplantation. EXAM is free software written in the R programming language.

## How was EXAM developed?

EXAM was developed by [Swisstransplant](https://www.swisstransplant.org/)---the national organisation for organ donation and transplantation in Switzerland in collaboration with three Swiss transplant centers.

## What is EXAM used for?

EXAM will enable transplant organizations to analyze their data, perform statistics, and conduct quality checks, enabling them to identify potential issues and optimize machine perfusion processes, ultimately benefiting kidney recipients.

Hypothermic machine perfusion data alone should never be used as the sole basis to discard a kidney allograft.
