	Abstract = {The appropriate clinical management of the integrated process of Donation and Transplantation implies the participation of the Transplant Coordinator. The aim of this article is to present the process of Certification of Transplant Coordinators in Europe since 2001, in accordance with the Council of Europe Recommendations and the evolving model implemented in 2008 under the auspices of the UEMS, reporting the longest running European standardized assessment of Transplant Coordination skills and knowledge. It includes the rationale for development of a certification process, how the examinations were developed and updated, eligibility to take the examination, and relationship with standards of practice for Transplant Coordinators. A total of 455 healthcare professionals were certified in two phases: 1(st) ETCO certification since 2001 to 2007 (390) and 2(nd) ETCO/UEMS certification from 2008 to 2011 (65).},
