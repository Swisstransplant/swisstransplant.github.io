	Abstract = {<h4>Background</h4>In Switzerland, heart transplantation is limited by donor availability. Marginal donor hearts-characterized by older age, comorbidities, or reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)-are often declined despite being structurally normal. Since impaired LVEF may be reversible, optimized donor management could improve cardiac function and transplant eligibility.<h4>Methods</h4>This retrospective cohort study analyzed 415 brain-dead donors (2017-2021) from the Swiss Organ Allocation System. Donors were categorized as optimal (LVEF ≥50%) or marginal (LVEF 15-49%), irrespective of structural abnormalities, to focus on a modifiable functional parameter. Predictors of heart transplantation were assessed using univariate and multivariable logistic regression. Additional analyses evaluated hemodynamic monitoring, diagnostic strategies, management duration, and functional recovery based on serial echocardiography.<h4>Results</h4>Among 415 donors, 287 were optimal and 62 marginal. Transplantation rates were higher in optimal hearts (62.7% vs. 23.6%, p < 0.001). LVEF ≥50% independently predicted transplantation (adjusted OR = 4.56; 95% CI: 2.34-8.89; p < 0.001), together with younger age, lower norepinephrine dose, central monitoring, and repeated echocardiography. Marginal hearts demonstrated significant improvement in LVEF after optimized management (p < 0.0001), suggesting that reversible dysfunction can be mitigated through tailored hemodynamic and pharmacologic strategies.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Optimized donor management can restore left ventricular function in marginal hearts and enhance transplant eligibility. Standardized national guidelines may help expand the donor pool and improve transplantation outcomes.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Background</h4>Donation after circulatory death (DCD) may be complicated by incidental findings, including tumor lesions that require urgent diagnosis. Here, we describe the case of a DCD donor with a large adnexal mass. Abdominal normothermic regional perfusion (A-NRP) enabled the safe resection of the mass, real-time pathological analysis, and subsequent kidney transplantation.<h4>Case summary</h4>A 60-year-old woman suffered a hypoxic cardiac arrest and subsequently remained in a deep coma with poor neurological prognostic indicators. In accordance with her presumed wishes, life support was withdrawn, and a controlled DCD procedure with A-NRP was initiated. Imaging revealed a 27-cm adnexal mass. Laboratory markers showed elevated cancer antigen 125 (CA 125) but low cancer antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), and cytology was negative. Bilateral oophorectomy was performed under A-NRP, and the frozen section excluded malignancy, with final pathology confirming an ovarian thecoma. Both kidneys were procured; only the left kidney was transplanted successfully. The recipient experienced immediate diuresis and regained stable renal function at 1 month.<h4>Discussion</h4>This case illustrates how A-NRP provides oxygenated perfusion while allowing time for surgical excision and a pathological diagnosis of incidental tumors. It prevented unnecessary donor exclusion and enabled transplantation.<h4>Conclusion</h4>In selected DCD donors with incidental lesions, A-NRP can safely bridge the diagnostic process, preserve organ viability, and expand the donor pool.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Aims of the study</h4>Deceased donation activity is typically calculated as the number of donors per year per million people (pmp) and is referred to as using the donation rate. To assess donation efficiency rather than donation activity, concepts such as the Donor Conversion Index (DCI) consider that not every death is eligible for organ donation. These are primarily deaths resulting from diseases associated with potentially devastating cerebral injury leading to brain death. We present the 2014-2023 evolution of the deceased donation activity and efficiency in Switzerland compared with selected European countries. How does Switzerland perform when organ donation programmes are evaluated using the DCI instead of the donation rate? The results are discussed in the context of implemented measures in Switzerland to increase organ donation activity.<h4>Methods</h4>We calculated the DCI (number of donors divided by the number of eligible deaths, multiplied by 100), donation rate (number of donors divided by the number of residents, multiplied by 106), and mortality rate (number of eligible deaths divided by the number of residents, multiplied by 105) for each country and year using population-based data from the Global Observatory on Donation and Transplantation (GODT) and Eurostat. Eligible deaths for deceased organ donation include deaths from diseases associated with potentially devastating cerebral injury related to brain death, as defined by selected ICD-10 codes suggested by the European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines & Healthcare. We present trends for the years 2014-2023 for all three indicators and compare the results of Switzerland with those of seven European countries (Austria, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and the United Kingdom).<h4>Results</h4>Over the 10-year study period, efficiency, as measured by the DCI, increased by 2-72% in all countries. In Switzerland, the DCI rose from 3.2 donors per 100 eligible deaths in 2014 to 5.5 donors per 100 eligible deaths in 2023, representing the largest increase in efficiency among the countries analysed (+2.3 donors per 100 eligible deaths, or +72%). The primary driver of Switzerland's improved donation efficiency was increased donations after circulatory determination of death (DCD) since 2016. The DCI offers a different perspective on donation activity compared with the donation rate expressed in pmp. The upward trend over the past decade in the countries analysed is less pronounced for the donation rate than for the DCI. This divergence is accompanied by a declining mortality rate of diseases eligible for donation during the period studied. At the end of the study period, Switzerland's total DCI ranked second among the countries analysed, following Spain, while its donation rate in pmp ranked fourth, following Italy and France. Among the countries analysed, Switzerland had the lowest mortality rate of diseases eligible for organ donation throughout the study period.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Despite declining next-of-kin consent rates, Switzerland's organ donation programme is among the most efficient in Europe, according to the DCI. If consent matched that of other countries, efficiency could be even higher. The increase in the DCI from 2014 to 2023 suggests that measures to increase organ donation rates in Switzerland may have been effective. Swiss emergency and intensive care staff appear to appropriately identify, refer, and manage potential deceased organ donors. When comparing trends in organ donation figures between countries, it is important to consider differences in mortality due to eligible diseases associated with potentially devastating cerebral injury leading to brain death.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Introduction</h4>The Swiss allocation system for kidney transplantation has evolved over time to balance medical urgency, immunological compatibility, and waiting time. Since the introduction of the transplantation law in 2007, which imposed organ allocation on a national level, the algorithm has been optimized. Initially based on waiting time, HLA compatibility, and crossmatch performed by cell complement-dependent cytotoxicity techniques, the system moved in 2012 to a score including HLA compatibility, waiting time, anti-HLA antibodies detected by the Luminex<sup>®</sup> technology, and a virtual crossmatch. In 2015, the score was optimized to balance the impact of preemptive listing and HLA matching of hyperimmunized recipients.<h4>Methods</h4>We reviewed access to transplants and post-transplant outcomes along those changes, defining three periods (v0: 2007-2012, v1: 2012-2015, v2: 2015-2020).<h4>Results</h4>Changes in the Swiss allocation system improved the fairness of access to transplantation, particularly for hyperimmunized patients. However, the system still fails to grant fair access to some blood groups. Furthermore, our data showed that rule modifications did not impact early post-transplant complications, maintaining similar time to first rejection and 1-year graft survival across subgroups.<h4>Discussion</h4>Such an analysis is useful for validating changes made to the allocation system and identifying aspects that need to be implemented in future revisions.},

	Abstract = {Deceased-donor kidney allografts are exposed to ischemic injury during ex vivo transport due to the lack of blood oxygen supply. Hypothermic machine perfusion (HMP) effectively reduces the risk of delayed graft function in kidney transplant recipients compared to standard cold storage. However, no free software implementation is available to analyze HMP data for state-of-the-art visualization and quality control. We developed the tool EXAM (ex-vivo allograft monitoring) as an interactive analytics dashboard. We wrote functions in the R programming language to read, process, and analyze HMP data from the LifePort kidney transporter (Organ Recovery Systems, USA). Time series for pressure, flow rate, organ resistance, and temperature are visualized, and relevant statistical indicators have been developed. We explain how data were processed, and indicators were calculated, and we present summary statistics for N = 255 kidney allografts receiving machine perfusion in Switzerland between 2020 and 2023. Median (interdecile range, IDR) of the main indicators were as follows: perfusion duration 5.18 hours (2.29-11.2), flow rate 110 ml/min (52.9-167), ice temperature 1.97°C (1.53-3.07), and perfusate temperature 6.68°C (5.58-8.36). We implemented the dashboard to identify issues, such as atypical perfusion parameters, high ice, or high perfusate temperature to inform transplant centers for quality assurance. In conclusion, EXAM is a free tool that statisticians and data scientists can quickly deploy to enable quality control at transplant organizations that use LifePort kidney transporters.

The avoidance of financial loss due to donation of organs, tissues, and cells is also now recognized as an ethical imperative that fosters equity in donation and transplantation and supports the well-being of donors and their families. Nevertheless, there has been little progress in achieving financial neutrality in donations in most countries. We present here the findings of an international ethics working group convened in preparation for the 2023 Global Summit on Convergence in Transplantation, held in Santander, Spain, which was tasked with formulating recommendations for action to promote financial neutrality in donation. In particular, we discuss the potential difficulty of distinguishing interventions that address donation-related costs from those that may act as a financial incentive for donation, which may inhibit efforts to cover costs. We also outline some practical strategies to assist governments in designing, implementing, and evaluating policies and programs to support progress toward financial neutrality in donation.},

	Abstract = {Trafficking in human organs, cells, and tissues has long been a source of concern for health authorities and professionals, and several international ethical guidance documents and national laws have affirmed the prohibition of trade in these substances of human origin (SoHOs). However, despite considerable attention to the issue of organ trafficking, this remains a substantial and widespread problem internationally. In contrast, trafficking in cells, tissues, and medical products derived from SoHOs has received comparatively little attention, and the extent and nature of such trafficking remain largely unknown. Consequently, as part of the 2023 Global Summit on Convergence in Transplantation held in Santander, Spain, an ethics working group was assigned the task of formulating actionable recommendations to support the prevention of trafficking in all SoHOs. In reporting on this work, we review factors that may influence the persistent trafficking of SoHOs, explore the potential difficulties associated with the collection and reporting of data about suspected trafficking activities, and argue that more practical and consistent guidance, training, and regulatory frameworks are needed internationally to support effective reporting, sharing of data, and collaborative responses to suspected trafficking cases. We also discuss the importance of psychosocial evaluation of living donors as a strategy to detect and prevent organ trafficking and strive to advance the implementation of this well-established recommendation by outlining minimum standards for psychosocial evaluation of living donors.},

This can lead to overly optimistic waiting times for all transplant programs and, consequently, may deceive patients on the waiting list, transplant physicians, and health care policymakers.<h4>Objective</h4>To apply competing-risk multistate models to calculate probabilities for transplantation and adverse outcomes on the Swiss national transplant waiting list.<h4>Design, setting, and participants</h4>The WAIT (Waitlist Analysis in Transplantation) study was a retrospective cohort study of all transplant candidates in Switzerland listed from January 1, 2018, or later and observed until December 31, 2023. Transplant candidates were listed in 1 of the 6 transplant centers (Basel, Bern, Geneva, Lausanne, St Gallen, and Zurich) for heart, liver, lungs, kidney, or pancreas and/or islet transplant. A total of 4352 candidates were listed during the study period, of whom 709 (16.3%) were excluded due to living-donor transplant (691 in the kidney program and 18 in the liver program).<h4>Exposure</h4>Waiting for organ transplant.<h4>Main outcomes and measures</h4>Time to transplantation, death, or delisting. Competing-risk multistate models were used to analyze time-to-event data from the national organ waiting list with the Aalen-Johansen estimator to compute probabilities for both transplant and adverse outcomes. Results were compared with the sample median among only those undergoing transplant and the Kaplan-Meier method with censoring of competing events.<h4>Results</h4>Data from 3643 transplant candidates (2428 [66.6%] male; median age, 56 [range, 0-79] years) were included in the analysis. The median time to transplantation (MTT) was 0.91 (95% CI, 0.83-1.07) years for heart, 3.10 (95% CI, 2.57-3.77) years for kidney, 1.32 (95% CI, 0.76-1.55) years for liver, 0.80 (95% CI, 0.37-1.12) years for lung, and 1.62 (95% CI, 0.91-2.17) years for pancreas and/or islet programs. Alternative estimation methods introduced bias to varying degrees: the sample median among only persons undergoing transplantation underestimated the waiting time by 38% to 61% and the Kaplan-Meier method by 2% to 12% compared with the MTT.<h4>Conclusions and relevance</h4>In this cohort study of transplant candidates in Switzerland, the MTT, the duration at which the transplant probability is 0.50, was used as a measure of average waiting time. Suboptimal methods led to biased and overly optimistic waiting time estimations; thus, applying appropriate competing-risk methods to address censoring and competing events is crucial.},

Healthcare staff may exclude potential donors for medical reasons, which are no longer applicable. Hence, Swisstransplant implemented a digital donor evaluation tool (DET) in 2021, which allows the local hospital's organ donation coordinator to send a direct request to medical advisors (MA) of the organ procurement organization before excluding potential donors. All 156 requests entered in 2022 were analyzed. 117 patients (75.0%) were primarily accepted by the MA as potential donors. Of those 60 patients (51.3%) became actual organ donors. Main reasons for using the DET were questions regarding malignancies (n = 33, 21.2%), infectious diseases (n = 35, 22.4%) and age/co-morbidities (n = 34, 21.8%). The average age of the actual "DET donor" compared to the regularly enrolled, actual "Non-DET donor" was 65.3 ± 15.8 vs. 56.8 ± 17.5 years, respectively (<i>p</i> = 0.008). On average 1.9 ± 1.1 organs compared to 3.2 ± 1.3 organs were retrieved from DET vs. Non-DET donors. In summary, this new digital donor evaluation tool supports reporting and facilitates eligibility decisions in uncertain, complex donor cases, potentially increasing the number of organ donations.},

Of these, 26/136 (19%) organs were accepted and transplanted: 18 hearts were transplanted in Switzerland, and 13 of these were foreign. Reasons for refusal were (1) no compatible recipient due to blood group or weight mismatch, 89.4%; (2) medical, meaning organ too marginal for transplantation, 7.4%; (3) logistic, 1.4%; and (4) other, 1.8%. Five organs were refused in Switzerland by one center but later accepted and successfully transplanted by another center. Hearts from outside Switzerland were transplanted significantly less than Swiss hearts (n = 16/120 vs. 10/16, p < .001).<h4>Conclusion</h4>The most common reason for refusing a pediatric donor heart is lack of compatibility with the recipient. Few hearts are refused for medical reasons. A more generous acceptance seems to be justified in selected patients. Switzerland receives a high number of foreign offers, but their rate of acceptance is lower than that of Swiss donations.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Purpose</h4>To establish a national consensus on contraindications for corneal donation for transplantation in Switzerland.<h4>Methods</h4>Swisstransplant (SWT), the Swiss national foundation coordinating tissue and organ donations, convened a working group consisting of six national corneal surgeons and eye bankers and donation experts to create a contraindication list for corneal donation. The group reviewed available national and international guidelines and recommendations, while adhering to Swiss law and transplant regulations. In cases of opposing opinions, the group held follow-up meetings until a consensus was reached. A consensus was defined as agreement among all parties present.<h4>Results</h4>From March 2021 to November 2021, the study group held six meetings and created a standardized minimal contraindication list for corneal donation in Switzerland. Thanks to this list, SWT has created a mandatory working and documentation file for donor coordinators to use when evaluating multiorgan donors for corneal harvesting. The authors agreed that while the national consensus list provides standardized minimal contraindication criteria, local eye banks may choose to introduce additional, more rigorous criteria.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Given that corneal transplantation is the most commonly performed transplantation, establishing a consensus on contraindications is crucial for recipient safety. The creation of a consensus on contraindications for corneal donation in Switzerland is an essential contribution to fulfil the legal requirements concerning quality assurance and provides sufficient high-quality donor tissue within the country. Therefore, periodic review and revision of the consensus is considered critical.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: We have examined the primary efficacy results of 23,551 randomized clinical trials from the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. METHODS: We estimate that the great majority of trials have much lower statistical power for actual effects than the 80 or 90% for the stated effect sizes. Consequently, “statistically significant” estimates tend to seriously overestimate actual treatment effects, “nonsignificant” results often correspond to important effects, and efforts to replicate often fail to achieve “significance” and may even appear to contradict initial results. To address these issues, we reinterpret the P value in terms of a reference population of studies that are, or could have been, in the Cochrane Database. RESULTS: This leads to an empirical guide for the interpretation of an observed P value from a “typical” clinical trial in terms of the degree of overestimation of the reported effect, the probability of the effect’s sign being wrong, and the predictive power of the trial. CONCLUSIONS: Such an interpretation provides additional insight about the effect under study and can guard medical researchers against naive interpretations of the P value and overoptimistic effect sizes. Because many research fields suffer from low power, our results are also relevant outside the medical domain. (Funded by the U.S. Office of Naval Research.)},

We analyzed organ offers from 01.06.2015-31.12.2021 and present the number of offers and transplants, and utilization as percentage of transplanted organs. 1,483 organs were offered, 287 were transplanted (19.4% utilization). Yearly number of offers and transplants increased from 2017 to 2021, while utilization stabilized after 2018. Utilization was highest for organs offered by Slovakia (47.2%), followed for organs offered by Lithuania, France, Greece, and Czechia (19.3%-22.9%). The most frequently offered organ was the heart (n = 405; 27.3%), followed by the lungs (n = 369; 24.9%) and the liver (n = 345; 23.3%). Utilization differed significantly by organ type (highest for liver, 35.7%; followed by heart, 18.8%; and kidney, 18.3%) and by donor age (highest for 1 to 5 year-old donors (25.0%)). FOEDUS-EOEO allowed for many European patients receiving a long-awaited transplant, especially for very young pediatric patients waiting for a liver, a heart, or a kidney. The increasing number of participating countries has increased both the number of offered organs and, to a lesser extent, the number of transplanted organs.},

Of those, we performed 158 DCD III liver transplants at our institution, with 1-year patient survival and death censored graft survival (death with functioning graft) of 87 and 89%, respectively, thus comparable to benchmark graft survivals of ideal DBD and DCD liver transplants (89% and 86%). Correspondingly, graft loss for primary non-function or cholangiopathy was overall low, i.e., 7/158 (4.4%) and 11/158 (6.9%), despite more than 82% of DCD liver grafts ranked high (6-10 points) or futile risk (>10 points) according to the UK-DCD score. Consistently, death censored graft survival was not different between low-, high-risk or futile DCD III livers. The key behind these achievements was the careful development and implementation of a routine perfusate assessment of mitochondrial biomarkers for injury and function, i.e., release of flavin mononucleotide from complex I, perfusate NADH, and mitochondrial CO<sub>2</sub> production during HOPE, allowing a more objective interpretation of liver quality on a subcellular level, compared to donor derived data.<h4>Interpretation</h4>HOPE after cold storage is a highly suitable and easy to perform perfusion approach, which allows reliable liver graft assessment, enabling surgeons to make a fact based decision on whether or not to implant the organ. HOPE-treatment should be combined with viability assessment particularly when used for high-risk organs, including DCD livers or organs with relevant steatosis.<h4>Funding</h4>This study was supported by the Swiss National Foundation (SNF) grant 320030_189055/1 to PD.},

A secondary objective was to assess the impact of legislation on consent rates for organ donation. The Council of Europe surveyed 39 member states about national regulations, practices, and consent rates; 34 replied. Opt-out legislation is present in 19, opt-in in 9 and a mixed system in six countries. An opt-out register is kept by 24 countries and an opt-in register by 18 countries, some keeping both. The mean consent rate was 81.2% of all family approaches. Most countries regulate how death using neurological criteria is confirmed (85.3%), while regulation of other aspects of the deceased donation pathway varies: the timing of informing the family about brain death (47.1%) and organ donation (58.8%), the profile of professional who discusses both topics with the family (52.9% and 64.7%, respectively) and the withdrawal of treatment after brain death (47.1%). We also noted a mismatch between what regulations state and what is done in practice in most countries. We suggest possible reasons for this disparity.},

However, in Switzerland, no widely accepted prognostic model or risk score for transplantation outcomes is being routinely used in clinical practice yet. We aim to develop three prediction models for the prognosis of graft survival, quality of life, and graft function following transplantation in Switzerland.<h4>Methods</h4>The clinical kidney prediction models (KIDMO) are developed with data from a national multi-center cohort study (Swiss Transplant Cohort Study; STCS) and the Swiss Organ Allocation System (SOAS). The primary outcome is the kidney graft survival (with death of recipient as competing risk); the secondary outcomes are the quality of life (patient-reported health status) at 12 months and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) slope. Organ donor, transplantation, and recipient-related clinical information will be used as predictors at the time of organ allocation. We will use a Fine & Gray subdistribution model and linear mixed-effects models for the primary and the two secondary outcomes, respectively. Model optimism, calibration, discrimination, and heterogeneity between transplant centres will be assessed using bootstrapping, internal-external cross-validation, and methods from meta-analysis.<h4>Discussion</h4>Thorough evaluation of the existing risk scores for the kidney graft survival or patient-reported outcomes has been lacking in the Swiss transplant setting. In order to be useful in clinical practice, a prognostic score needs to be valid, reliable, clinically relevant, and preferably integrated into the decision-making process to improve long-term patient outcomes and support informed decisions for clinicians and their patients. The state-of-the-art methodology by taking into account competing risks and variable selection using expert knowledge is applied to data from a nationwide prospective multi-center cohort study. Ideally, healthcare providers together with patients can predetermine the risk they are willing to accept from a deceased-donor kidney, with graft survival, quality of life, and graft function estimates available for their consideration.<h4>Study registration</h4>Open Science Framework ID: z6mvj.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Background & aims</h4>Liver graft utilization rates are a hot topic due to the worldwide organ shortage and the increasing number of transplant candidates on waiting lists. Liver perfusion techniques have been introduced in several countries, and may help to increase the organ supply, as they potentially enable the assessment of livers before use.<h4>Methods</h4>Liver offers were counted from donation after circulatory death (DCD) donors (Maastricht type III) arising during the past decade in eight countries, including Belgium, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland, the UK, and the US. Initial type-III DCD liver offers were correlated with accepted, recovered and implanted livers.<h4>Results</h4>A total number of 34,269 DCD livers were offered, resulting in 9,780 liver transplants (28.5%). The discard rates were highest in the UK and US, ranging between 70 and 80%. In contrast, much lower DCD liver discard rates, e.g. between 30-40%, were found in Belgium, France, Italy, Spain and Switzerland. In addition, we observed large differences in the use of various machine perfusion techniques, as well as in graft and donor risk factors. For example, the median donor age and functional donor warm ischemia time were highest in Italy, e.g. >40 min, followed by Switzerland, France, and the Netherlands. Importantly, such varying risk profiles of accepted DCD livers between countries did not translate into large differences in 5-year graft survival rates, which ranged between 60-82% in this analysis.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Overall, DCD liver discard rates across the eight countries were high, although this primarily reflects the situation in the Netherlands, the UK and the US. Countries where in situ and ex situ machine perfusion strategies were used routinely had better DCD utilization rates without compromised outcomes.<h4>Impact and implications</h4>A significant number of Maastricht type III DCD livers are discarded across Europe and North America today. The overall utilization rate among eight Western countries is 28.5% but varies significantly between 18.9% and 74.2%. For example, the median DCD-III liver utilization in five countries, e.g. Belgium, France, Italy, Switzerland, and Spain is 65%, in contrast to 24% in the Netherlands, UK and US. Despite this, and despite different rules and strategies for organ acceptance and preservation, 1- and 5-year graft survival rates remain fairly similar among all participating countries. A highly varying experience with modern machine perfusion technology was observed. In situ and ex situ liver perfusion concepts, and application of assessment tools for type-III DCD livers before transplantation, may be a key explanation for the observed differences in DCD-III utilization.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Aims of the study</h4>Organ donation after circulatory death (DCD) was reintroduced in Switzerland in 2011 and accounts for a third of deceased organ donors today. Controversy persists if DCD transplants are of similar quality to transplants following donation after brain death (DBD), mainly due to warm ischaemia time DCD organs are exposed to. We compared DCD with DBD in Switzerland.<h4>Methods</h4>Data on deceased adults who were referred to and approved for organ donation from 1 September 2011 to 31 December 2019 were retrospectively analysed (217 DCD, 840 DBD donors). We compared DCD and DBD donor/organ characteristics, transplant rates of lungs, liver, kidneys, and pancreas, and early liver and kidney graft function in the recipient. The effect of DCD/DBD on transplant rates (organ transplanted or not) and 72-hour recipient graft function (moderate/good vs delayed graft function / organ loss) was analysed using multivariable logistic regression. Among utilised DCD donors, we analysed the effect of functional warm ischaemia time (FWIT) and donor age on 72-hour post-transplant liver and kidney graft function, also using multivariable logistic regression.<h4>Results</h4>DCD donors were more often male (64.5% vs 56.8% p = 0.039), presented with heart disease (36.4% vs 25.5%, p <0.001), were resuscitated before hospital admission (41.9% vs 30.7%, p = 0.006), and died from anoxia (41.9% vs 23.9%). Kidney function before transplantation was comparable, lung, liver and pancreas function were poorer in DCD than DBD. Eighty-one and 91% of approved DCD and DBD donors were utilised (p <0.001). Median FWIT in DCD was 29 minutes (interquartile range 25-35). DCD transplant rates ranged from 4% (pancreas) to 73% (left kidney) and were all lower compared with DBD. Seventy-two-hour liver graft function was comparable between DCD and DBD (94.2% vs 96.6% moderate/good, p = 0.199). DCD kidney transplants showed increased risk of delayed graft function or early organ loss (odds ratios 8.32 and 5.05; 95% confidence intervals CI 5.28-13.28 and 3.22-7.95; both p <0.001, for left and right kidney transplants, respectively). No negative effect of prolonged FWIT or higher donor age was detected.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Despite less favourable donor/organ characteristics compared with donation after brain death, donation after circulatory death donors are increasingly referred and today provide an important source for scarce transplants in Switzerland. We identified a higher risk for delayed graft function or early organ loss for DCD kidney transplants, but not for DCD liver transplants. When carefully selected and allowed for other risk factors in organ allocation, prolonged functional warm ischaemia time or higher age in donation after circulatory death does not seem to be associated with impaired graft function early after transplantation.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Purpose</h4>Proteinuria is frequent in patients with nephropathies and associated with progressive kidney disease and risk for end stage kidney disease. However, the relevance of deceased donor proteinuria on transplant outcome remains uncertain. In this nationwide cohort study, we evaluated the prevalence of proteinuria in deceased donor candidates and measured the impact on outcome after kidney transplantation.<h4>Methods</h4>Data from the Swiss Organ Allocation System and the Swiss Transplant Cohort Study were analyzed, comprising 1725 donors and 1516 recipients transplanted between 2008 and 2019. We correlated urine findings with donor characteristics and quantified the impact of proteinuria on allograft function at 12 months and survival.<h4>Results</h4>Proteinuria influenced allocation decisions in 4.5% of nonimmunological organ declines and was the leading cause for decline in 0.2% of cases. 74.1%, 51.4%, and 35.3% of donor candidates had a baseline proteinuria above 15, 30, and 50 mg protein/mmol urine creatinine, respectively. Proteinuria above 30 mg/mmol was associated with female donor sex, mechanical resuscitation, acute kidney injury, and time delay between ICU entry and urine sampling. Donor proteinuria was not associated with patient or allograft survival, nor allograft function at 12 months.<h4>Conclusion</h4>We report a high prevalence of proteinuria in donor candidates, without evidence of a deleterious impact of proteinuria on graft function and/or survival. Therefore, low-level proteinuria should not be considered a limiting contraindication for kidney allocation in deceased donor transplant.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Background</h4>Preliminary data suggest that COVID-19 has reduced access to solid organ transplantation. However, the global consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on transplantation rates and the effect on waitlisted patients have not been reported. We aimed to assess the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on transplantation and investigate if the pandemic was associated with heterogeneous adaptation in terms of organ transplantation, with ensuing consequences for waitlisted patients.<h4>Methods</h4>In this population-based, observational, before-and-after study, we collected and validated nationwide cohorts of consecutive kidney, liver, lung, and heart transplants from 22 countries. Data were collected from Jan 1 to Dec 31, 2020, along with data from the same period in 2019. The analysis was done from the onset of the 100th cumulative COVID-19 case through to Dec 31, 2020. We assessed the effect of the pandemic on the worldwide organ transplantation rate and the disparity in transplant numbers within each country. We estimated the number of waitlisted patient life-years lost due to the negative effects of the pandemic. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04416256.<h4>Findings</h4>Transplant activity in all countries studied showed an overall decrease during the pandemic. Kidney transplantation was the most affected, followed by lung, liver, and heart. We identified three organ transplant rate patterns, as follows: countries with a sharp decrease in transplantation rate with a low COVID-19-related death rate; countries with a moderate decrease in transplantation rate with a moderate COVID-19-related death rate; and countries with a slight decrease in transplantation rate despite a high COVID-19-related death rate. Temporal trends revealed a marked worldwide reduction in transplant activity during the first 3 months of the pandemic, with losses stabilising after June, 2020, but decreasing again from October to December, 2020. The overall reduction in transplants during the observation time period translated to 48 239 waitlisted patient life-years lost.<h4>Interpretation</h4>We quantified the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on worldwide organ transplantation activity and revealed heterogeneous adaptation in terms of organ transplantation, both at national levels and within countries, with detrimental consequences for waitlisted patients. Understanding how different countries and health-care systems responded to COVID-19-related challenges could facilitate improved pandemic preparedness, notably, how to safely maintain transplant programmes, both with immediate and non-immediate life-saving potential, to prevent loss of patient life-years.<h4>Funding</h4>French national research agency (INSERM) ATIP Avenir and Fondation Bettencourt Schueller.},

	Abstract = {Chronic organ shortage remains the most limiting factor in lung transplantation. To overcome this shortage, a minority of centers have started with efforts to reintroduce donation after circulatory death (DCD). This review aims to evaluate the experimental background, the current international clinical experience, and the further potential and challenges of the different DCD categories. Successful strategies have been implemented to reduce the problems of warm ischemic time, thrombosis after circulatory arrest, and difficulties in organ assessment, which come with DCD donation. From the currently reported results, controlled-DCD lungs are an effective and safe method with good mid-term and even long-term survival outcomes comparable to donation after brain death (DBD). Primary graft dysfunction and onset of chronic allograft dysfunction seem also comparable. Thus, controlled-DCD lungs should be ceased to be treated as marginal and instead be promoted as an equivalent alternative to DBD. A wide implementation of controlled-DCD-lung donation would significantly decrease the mortality on the waiting list. Therefore, further efforts in establishment of legislation and logistics are crucial. With regard to uncontrolled DCD, more data are needed analyzing long-term outcomes. To help with the detailed assessment and improvement of uncontrolled or otherwise questionable grafts after retrieval, ex-vivo lung perfusion is promising.},

	Abstract = {Kidney transplantation from older and marginal donors is effective to confront organ shortage. However, limitations after transplantation of kidneys from very marginal kidney donors remain unclear. We compared patient and graft outcome, achieved allograft function and quality of life of renal transplantations from Very Senior Donors (VSD, defined as donors aged 70 years and older) with Senior Donors (SD, aged 60-70 years) and Regular Donors (RD, aged younger than 60 years) in Switzerland. We evaluated the outcome of 1554 adult recipients of deceased donor kidney transplantations from 05/2008 to 12/2019; median follow-up was 4.7 years. Failure-free survival (freedom from graft loss or death), glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and quality of life at 12 months were analyzed for RD (reference group, n = 940), SD (n = 404), and VSD (n = 210). Failure-free survival decreased with increasing donor age, mainly attributable to premature graft loss. Still, overall 5-year failure-free survival reached 83.1%, 81.0%, and 64.0% in the RD, SD, and VSD subgroups, respectively. eGFR 12 months post-transplantation was significantly higher in RD compared with SD and VSD. The acceptance rate of donor candidates for kidney TPL was 78% for the entire cohort (87% for RD, 79% for SD, and 56% for VSD). Deceased donor kidney transplantation from donors aged 70 years or older is associated with an inferior, yet acceptable failure-free outcome, with sustained quality of life.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Aims of the study</h4>The lack of suitable donor organs limits the number of solid organ transplants. Patients who underwent cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) after cardiac arrest may represent a sizeable subgroup of deceased organ donors, as they often progress to brain death or have life-sustaining therapy withdrawn. We aimed to quantify deceased organ donation after CPR in Switzerland for the first time by analysing the characteristics of potential and utilised organ donors after CPR.<h4>Methods</h4>Data on deceased adult and paediatric patients who were reported to and approved by Swisstransplant for organ donation were analysed, including both donation after brain death (DBD) and donation after controlled cardiocirculatory death (cDCD) from 2016 to 2018. We analysed baseline characteristics of potential donors who underwent CPR in the context of their hospitalisation, as compared with donors without prior CPR. Considering the varying characteristics between these two donor groups, we assessed the effect of CPR on different allocation outcomes (donor and organ utilisation, organ yield per utilised donor) using multivariable regression. Additionally, we present selected CPR circumstances and compared different subgroups of CPR donors according to duration of CPR and duration of no-flow time.<h4>Results</h4>Of the 461 deceased potential organ donors included in the analysis, 173 (37.5%) underwent CPR. CPR donors were, on average, younger (median age 53 vs 62, p &lt;0.001), had different causes of death (p &lt;0.001), and were more often of the cDCD type (30.1% vs 18.4%, p = 0.004) as compared with non-CPR donors. Of the 173 CPR donors, 152 (87.9%) could be utilised (minimum one organ transplanted), and in the multivariable analysis, utilisation rate was higher in the CPR donor group than in the non-CPR donor group (odds ratio 3.3, 95% confidence interval 1.1&ndash;11.5; p = 0.046). Organ specific utilisation of heart, liver, and kidney, and total organ yield per donor, did not differ significantly between CPR and non-CPR donors.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Our study reveals that a substantial proprotion of deceased organ donors in Switzerland underwent CPR in context of their hospitalisation. CPR donors are different from non-CPR donors with respect to age, cause of death and donation type. However, when carefully selected according to their haemodynamic condition, CPR donors are comparable to non-CPR donors in terms of donor and organ utilisation, as well as the average organ yield. Thus, all patients who are resuscitated from cardiac arrest but who subsequently progress to death should be evaluated for organ donation. How CPR donors compare with non-CPR donors regarding transplant outcomes should be studied further.},

Thus, we assessed occurrence and effects of infections with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on patients on the Swiss national waiting list for solid organ transplantation.<h4>Methods</h4>Patient data were retrospectively extracted from the Swiss Organ Allocation System (SOAS). From 16 March to 31 May 2020, we included all patients listed for solid organ transplantation on the Swiss national waiting list who were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Severity of COVID-19 was categorised as follows: stage I, mild symptoms; stage II, moderate to severe symptoms; stage III, critical symptoms; stage IV, death. We compared the incidence rate (laboratory-confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2), the hospital admission rate (number of admissions of SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals), and the case fatality rate (number of deaths of SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals) in our study population with the general Swiss population during the study period, calculating age-adjusted standardised incidence ratios and standardised mortality ratios, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).<h4>Results</h4>A total of 1439 patients were registered on the Swiss national solid organ transplantation waiting list on 31 May 31 2020. Twenty-four (1.7%) waiting list patients were reported to test positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the study period. The median age was 56 years (interquartile range 45.3&ndash;65.8), and 14 (58%) were male. Of all patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, two patients were asymptomatic, 14 (58%) presented in COVID-19 stage I, 3 (13%) in stage II, and 5 (21%) in stage III. Eight patients (33%) were admitted to hospital, four (17%) required intensive care, and three (13%) mechanical ventilation. Twenty-two patients (92%) of all those infected recovered, but two male patients aged &gt;65 years with multiple comorbidities died in hospital from respiratory failure. Comparing our study population with the general Swiss population, the age-adjusted standardised incidence ratio was 4.1 (95% CI 2.7&ndash;6.0).<h4>Conclusion</h4>The overall rate of SARS-CoV-2 infections in candidates awaiting solid organ transplantation was four times higher than in the Swiss general population; however, the frequency of testing likely played a role. Given the small sample size of affected patients, conclusions have to be drawn cautiously and results need verification in larger cohorts.},

	Abstract = {For infants, children, and adolescents with progressive advanced lung disease, lung transplantation represents the ultimate therapy option. Fortunately, outcomes after pediatric lung transplantation have improved in recent years now producing good long-term outcomes, no less than comparable to adult lung transplantation. The field of pediatric lung transplantation has rapidly advanced; thus, this review aims to update on important issues such as transplant referral and assessment, and extra-corporal life support as "bridge to transplantation". In view of the ongoing lack of donor organs limiting the success of pediatric lung transplantation, donor acceptability criteria and surgical options of lung allograft size reduction are discussed. Post-transplant, immunosuppression is vital for prevention of allograft rejection; however, evidence-based data on immunosuppression are scarce. Drug-related side effects are frequent, close therapeutic drug monitoring is highly advised with an individually tailored patient approach. Chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) remains the Achilles' heel of pediatric lung transplant limiting its long-term success. Unfortunately, therapy options for CLAD are still restricted. The last option for progressive CLAD would be consideration for lung re-transplant; however, numbers of pediatric patients undergoing lung re-transplantation are very small and its success depends highly on the optimal selection of the most suitable candidate.},

Based on a review of 577 consecutive deceased donors from the Swisstransplant Donor-Registry, 3 cases (0.5%) of fatal anaphylaxis were identified, 2 because of peanut and 1 of wasp allergy. The sera of all 3 donors and their 10 paired recipients, prospectively collected before and after transplantation for the Swiss Transplant Cohort Study, were retrospectively processed using a commercial protein microarray fluorescent test. As early as 5 days posttransplantation, newly acquired peanut-specific IgE were transiently detected from 1 donor to 3 recipients, of whom 1 liver and lung recipients developed grade III anaphylaxis. Yet, to define how allergy testing should be performed in transplant recipients and to better understand the impact of immunosuppressive therapy on IgE sensitization, we prospectively studied 5 atopic living-donor kidney recipients. All pollen-specific IgE and >90% of skin prick tests remained positive 7 days and 3 months after transplantation, indicating that early diagnosis of donor-derived IgE sensitization is possible. Importantly, we propose recommendations with respect to safety for recipients undergoing solid-organ transplantation from donors with a history of fatal anaphylaxis.},

DCD is practiced in 18 countries: eight have both controlled DCD (cDCD) and uncontrolled DCD (uDCD) programs, 4 only cDCD and 6 only uDCD. All these countries have legally binding and/or nonbinding texts to regulate the practice of DCD. The no-touch period ranges from 5 to 30 min. There are variations in ante and post mortem interventions used for the practice of cDCD. During 2008-2016, the highest DCD activity was described in the United Kingdom, Spain, Russia, the Netherlands, Belgium and France. Data on post-transplant outcomes of patients who receive DCD donor kidneys show better results with grafts obtained from cDCD versus uDCD donors. In conclusion, DCD is becoming increasingly accepted and performed in Europe, importantly contributing to the number of organs available and providing acceptable post-transplantation outcomes.},

	Abstract = {This study investigated the critical care staff's attitude, knowledge and involvement with donation, skills and confidence with donation-related tasks and their association with consent rates at the hospital level. In 2015, we conducted a cross-sectional survey among critical care staff of hospitals involved in organ donation using an anonymous online questionnaire with a response rate of 56.4% (n = 2799). The hospital level consent rate was obtained from the Swiss Monitoring of Potential Donors database (2013-2015). For each hospital, we calculated a mean score for each predictor of interest of the Hospital Attitude Survey and investigated the association with hospital consent rates with generalized linear mixed-effect models. In univariable analysis, one score point increase in doctors' confidence resulted in a 66% (95% CI: 45%-80%) reduction in the odds to consent, and one score point increase in nurses' attitudes resulted in a 223% (95% CI: 84%-472%) increase in the odds to consent. After simultaneously adjusting for all major predictors found in the crude models, only levels of education of medical and nursing staff remained as significant predictors for hospital consent rates. In Switzerland, efforts are needed to increase consent rates for organ donation and should concentrate on continuous support as well as specific training of the hospital staff involved in the donation process.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Background</h4>Various actions have been taken during the last decade to increase the number of organs from deceased donors available for transplantation in Switzerland. This study provides an overview on key figures of the Swiss deceased organ donation and transplant activity between 2008 and 2017. In addition, it puts the evolution of the Swiss donation program's efficiency in relation to the situation in the neighboring countries.<h4>Methods</h4>This study is an analysis of prospective registry data, covering the period from 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2017. It includes all actual deceased organ donors (ADD) in Switzerland. Donor data were extracted from the Swiss Organ Allocation System. The "donor conversion index" (DCI) methodology and data was used for the comparison of donation program efficiency in Switzerland, Germany, Austria, Italy and France.<h4>Results</h4>During the study period there were 1116 ADD in Switzerland. The number of ADD per year increased from 91 in 2008 to 145 in 2017 (+ 59%). The reintroduction of the donation after cardiocirculatory death (DCD) program in 2011 resulted in the growth of annual percentages of DCD donors, reaching a maximum of 27% in 2017. The total number of organs transplanted from ADD was 3763 (3.4 ± 1.5 transplants per donor on average). Of these, 48% were kidneys (n = 1814), 24% livers (n = 903), 12% lungs (n = 445), 9% hearts (n = 352) and 7% pancreata or pancreatic islets (n = 249). The donation program efficiency assessment showed an increase of the Swiss DCI from 1.6% in 2008 to 2.7% in 2017 (+ 69%). The most prominent efficiency growth was observed between 2012 and 2017. Even though Swiss donation efficiency increased during the study period, it remained below the DCI of the French and Austrian donation programs.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Swiss donation activity and efficiency grew during the last decade. The increased donation efficiency suggests that measures implemented so far were effective. The lower efficiency of the Swiss donation program, compared to the French and Austrian programs, may likely be explained by the lower consent rate in Switzerland. This issue should be addressed in order to achieve the goal of more organs available for transplantation.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Background</h4>The donation rate (DR) per million population is not ideal for an efficiency comparison of national deceased organ donation programs. The DR does not account for variabilities in the potential for deceased donation which mainly depends on fatalities from causes leading to brain death. In this study, the donation activity was put into relation to the mortality from selected causes. Based on that metric, this study assesses the efficiency of different donation programs.<h4>Methods</h4>This is a retrospective analysis of 2001 to 2015 deceased organ donation and mortality registry data. Included are 27 Council of Europe countries, as well as the United States. A donor conversion index (DCI) was calculated for assessing donation program efficiency over time and in international comparisons.<h4>Results</h4>According to the DCI and of the countries included in the study, Spain, France, and the United States had the most efficient donation programs in 2015. Even though mortality from the selected causes decreased in most countries during the study period, differences in international comparisons persist. This indicates that the potential for deceased organ donation and its conversion into actual donation is far from being similar internationally.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Compared with the DR, the DCI takes into account the potential for deceased organ donation, and therefore is a more accurate metric of performance. National donation programs could optimize performance by identifying the areas where most potential is lost, and by implementing measures to tackle these issues.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Aim</h4>Various scoring systems aim to assess the quality of organs donated for transplantation on the basis of patient characteristics, clinical examination and laboratory results. How well such scoring systems reflect the practice in lung transplantation in Switzerland has never been studied. Therefore, we evaluated two scoring systems for their ability to predict whether or not donor lungs are accepted by the two Swiss lung transplant centres.<h4>Methods</h4>We retrospectively analysed patient data of adult deceased organ donors in Switzerland between 1 July 2007 and 30 June 2014. Included were all donors from whom at least one organ was transplanted. We evaluated two lung donor quality scores, the multicentre-developed Eurotransplant donor score (EDS), and the single-centre-developed Zurich donor score (ZDS). Both scores were slightly adapted to be applicable to Swiss deceased organ donor data. We evaluated whether these scores can predict whether lungs were transplanted or refused by Swiss transplant centres, using univariate logistic regression. We further assessed their discriminative power by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).<h4>Results</h4>Of the 635 donors included in our analysis, 295 (46%) were accepted as lung donors by one of the two lung transplant centres in Switzerland. Our analysis showed that both scores can predict whether or not a donor lung is likely to be accepted for transplantation in Switzerland. As the score value of a donor increases, the odds of the lung being transplanted significantly decreases (odds ratio [OR] 0.58, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.51-0.65 for the adapted EDS; OR 0.35, 95% CI 0.28-0.43 for the adapted ZDS). This effect is slightly more pronounced in the adapted ZDS than in the adapted EDS. The discriminatory power of the scores from the AUC was 0.719 (95% CI 0.680-0.758) for the adapted EDS, and 0.723 (95% CI 0.681-0.760) for the adapted ZDS, which for both was deemed fair discrimination.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Both scoring systems are able to predict whether or not donor lungs are accepted by the two Swiss lung transplant centres. As an alternative to adapting an established scoring system, a national lung quality score could be derived de novo. This could be based on a logistic regression analysis including the most relevant donor characteristics. However, such a new score would need to be validated on an independent sample and ideally tested for its predictive value in terms of post-transplantation outcome.},

	Abstract = {Twenty-four percent of pediatric heart transplantations (pHTx) are carried out in infants. Neonatal heart transplantation is both rarely performed and challenging. We report on a newborn baby girl suffering from cardiac failure due to a huge tumor (24×52 mm) within the free wall of the left ventricle (LV) and subtotal obstruction of the main left bronchus. Following a surgical tumor resection, a Berlin Heart EXCOR left ventricular assist device was implanted as the bridge to the transplantation. In spite of an organ donor/recipient mismatch of >200%, both heart transplantation and the postoperative course were successful. In addition to this case report, the authors also present data from a survey on performed infant and neonatal transplantations in Western Europe. As neonatal heart transplantation is a rare event in Europe, the authors think it is of crucial importance to share this limited experience. We discuss an alternative strategy-namely, palliative surgical correction using the Fontan pathway. The challenges of donor/recipient weight mismatch and the possibilities of overcoming infant donor organ shortage as a postoperative immunosuppressive regimen are discussed as well.},

One of the reasons for this situation is the high percentage of patients or families who refuse to consent to donation. This study aimed to provide an overview of attitudes towards organ donation among Swiss residents, including any intention to donate organs after death, and whether they had already declared their wish and/or communicated it to anyone.<h4>Methods</h4>A representative poll investigating the attitude of the Swiss population towards deceased organ donation was conducted between 16 and 28 March 2015. Survey data were collected in 1000 structured telephone interviews. Participants consisted of residents aged 15 years and over from all Swiss regions, and covering the German, French and Italian language areas.<h4>Results</h4>Of the 1000 survey participants, 92% stated that they have a very positive (58%) or quite positive (33%) attitude towards organ donation, while 6% have a very negative (2%) or quite negative (4%) view. Some 81% of respondents said that they would be willing to donate their organs after death, and 9% expressed a wish not to become a donor. A total of 53% of participants said that they had already communicated or documented whether they wish to donate.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Our study highlights the importance of continuing to raise awareness about the importance of communicating wishes, both in written form and to family members, and suggests that more work is needed to reap the benefits of the substantial support for organ donation among the Swiss population.},

We report the impact of the new Swiss Organ Allocation System (SOAS) introduced in 2007, offering all kidney allografts from deceased donors <60 years preferentially to children. The retrospective cohort study included all paediatric transplant patients (<20 years of age) before (n = 19) and after (n = 32) the new SOAS (from 2001 to 2014). Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (UPC), need for antihypertensive medication, waiting times to kidney transplantation (KTX), number of pre-emptive transplantations and rejections, and the proportion of living donor transplants were considered as outcome parameters. Patients after the new SOAS had significantly better eGFRs 2 years after KTX (Mean Difference, MD = 25.7 ml/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> , P = 0.025), lower UPC ratios (Median Difference, MeD = -14.5 g/mol, P = 0.004), decreased waiting times to KTX (MeD = -97 days, P = 0.021) and a higher proportion of pre-emptive transplantations (Odds Ratio = 9.4, 95% CI = 1.1-80.3, P = 0.018), while the need for antihypertensive medication, number of rejections and living donor transplantations remained stable. The new SOAS is associated with improved short-term clinical outcomes and more rapid access to KTX. Despite lacking long-term research, the study results should encourage other policy makers to adopt the SOAS approach.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Background</h4>Organ exchange among organ procurement organisations (OPOs) serves three main purposes: firstly, it reduces the loss of donor organs for which there is no suitable recipient on the waiting list of an OPO; secondly, it improves the odds of specific patient groups for receiving a matching donor organ; thirdly, it allows an optimised donor-recipient match, due to an expansion of the donor and recipient pool. However, only few published studies provide figures for the significance of international organ sharing. This study aims to assess the impact of organ imports on the Swiss transplant activity.<h4>Methods</h4>We retrospectively analysed the data related to international organ exchange and its impact on the Swiss transplant activity. Information about organs from deceased donors offered by foreign OPOs was extracted from the Swiss Organ Allocation System for the period from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2013.<h4>Results</h4>During the study period, 1028 organs were offered by foreign OPOs for allocation to patients needing transplantation in Switzerland. Of all organs offered, 35.9% originated from the Agence de la Biomédecine (France) and 25.6% from the National Health Service Blood and Transplant (United Kingdom). Totally 137 organs (13.3%) were accepted by the Swiss transplant centres for transplantation. These imported organs account for 7.2% of the transplants performed between 2009 and 2013. The impact of imported organs on the transplant activity was largest for the liver (14.2%), followed by heart (8.9%), lung (6.3%) and kidney (4.0%).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our study showed that international organ exchange substantially contributed to the Swiss transplant activity during the period analysed. The collaboration between OPOs can be life-saving, especially for paediatric patients and selected adult transplant candidates. More patients might benefit from organ sharing if the standards for international collaboration could be further harmonised.},

Of the 723 hearts offered by Swisstransplant to the three university hospitals with a heart transplantation programme (Bern, Lausanne and Zurich), 199 (27.5%) were transplanted. Of these, 183 (92.0%) were procured in Switzerland and 16 (8.0%) were offered by a foreign organ procurement organisation. Fifty-two hearts were transplanted to patients who were listed in urgent status, equalling an urgent transplant rate of 26.1%. Whereas the overall waiting list mortality was 19.0%, it was as high as 31.8% in patients older than 60 years.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our study showed a growing Swiss heart transplant waiting list, as significantly more patients were newly waitlisted than transplanted. Compared with the international data, the acceptance rate of heart offers and the rate of urgent transplantations were relatively low, while the waiting list mortality was higher. The fact that the mortality was highest in candidates aged 60 and above suggests that the new generation of ventricular assist devices as destination therapy should be considered as an alternative to transplantation in selected patients.},

The objective of our study was an assessment of the donation after brain death (DBD) process in Swiss adult intensive care units (ICUs), and to provide an overview of the donation efficiency as well as of the reasons for non-donation.<h4>Methods</h4>SwissPOD is a prospective cohort study of all deaths in Swiss ICUs and accident and emergency departments. This study is an analysis of SwissPOD data of all patients who deceased in an adult ICU between 1 September 2011 and 31 August 2012.<h4>Results</h4>Out of 3,667 patients who died in one of the 79 adult ICUs participating in SwissPOD, 1,204 were possible, 198 potential, 133 eligible, and 94 utilised DBD donors. The consent rate was 48.0% and the conversion rate 47.5%. In 80.0% of cases, the requests for donation took place before brain death was diagnosed, resulting in a similar proportion of consents and objections as when requests were made after brain death diagnosis.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Despite the low donation rate, Swiss adult ICUs are performing well in terms of the conversion rate, similar to major European countries. The refusal rate is among the highest in Europe, which clearly has a negative impact on the donation rate. Optimising the request process seems to be the most effective means of increasing the donation rate.},

We collected data on patient demographics, characteristics of NOK, factors related to the request process and to the clinical setting. We analyzed the association of collected predictors with consent rate using univariable logistic regression models; predictors with p-values <0.2 were selected for a multivariable logistic regression.<h4>Results</h4>Of 266 NOK approached for consent, consent was given in 137 (51.5%) cases. In multivariable analysis, we found associations of consent rates with Swiss nationality (OR 3.09, 95% CI: 1.46-6.54) and German language area (OR 0.31, 95% CI: 0.14-0.73).

	Abstract = {The present article will give a related overview of the current background of the field of donor recruitment and transplantation medicine. The transplantation Law that came into effect on the 01.07.2007 has caused numerous changes in the identification and reporting of potential organ- and tissue donors in hospitals with accredited Intensive care units. The law has had a great influence on the allocation practice of the rare organs in Switzerland. With just 12.6 cadaveric donors per million inhabitants, Switzerland is, compared to other European countries at the bottom of the table. This is not without influence on the waiting list, which at the end of 2010 was at a new all time high with 1029 patients. We assume that almost half of the Swiss population has not yet decided if they want to donate their organs or not. The most important contact people in this subject are the practicing colleagues, by this we mean you. On a specially publicized Link [www.swisstransplant.org/medizinerinfo] you will find more information and documents that you can either put out in your practice or download them for further education. Organ donation is possible until a high age, bring this subject up with your patients, and inform them transparently and openly about this. Ask your patients to inform their loved ones of their decision for or against organ donation.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Background</h4>Transplantation today faces two major issues: organ shortage, and the increasing age of deceased donors. The former leads to growing waiting lists and, as a consequence, to a higher mortality of patients in need of an organ. The latter results in an augmentation of the proportion of organs from so called extended criteria donors, which, in the past, have been associated with inferior outcomes.<h4>Methods</h4>Retrospective analysis of the patient characteristics of all deceased organ donors in Switzerland from 1 January 1998 to 31 December 2008. A total of 1004 patient records of brain-dead organ donors (59.4% male, 40.6% female) were analysed for demographic data and causes of death.<h4>Results</h4>The average donor age increased from 43.8 ± 16.9 years in 1998 to 51.7 ± 18.0 years in 2008 (+27.6%; p <0.05). When comparing 2008 with 1998, cerebral haemorrhage accounts for 52.8% of the causes of death in 2008 (+16.7 percentage points), whereas the proportion of cranio-cerebral trauma decreased by 22 percentage points to 16.9%. The largest group of donors are the 16-55 year-olds with a 50% quota in 2008 (-23.6% compared with 1998). During the study period, the ≥65 year-old group had a 216.2% growth rate, and it accounts 26.6% of the donors in 2008 (p <0.05).<h4>Conclusions</h4>A shift in the causes of death significantly increased the average age of donors, and transplantation medicine is confronted with a growing number of extended criteria donors. Nevertheless, 10-year survival of transplant recipients is better than ever before.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Background</h4>The widening gap between the numbers of patients on the waiting list for organ transplantation and the insufficient numbers of organ donors results in the use of "critical" donors, so-called marginal donors or extended criteria donors. Data concerning the evaluation of extended criteria donors (ECD) in Switzerland are sparse.<h4>Methods</h4>All organ donors in Switzerland between 1.1.1998 and 30.6.2009 have been evaluated for special criteria. ECD were defined on the basis of at least one of seven criteria: six DOPKI criteria (ECD-DOPKI) and/or age ≥60 yr (ECD-Age). Once included in the study, special features, short time follow-up (first 7 days after transplantation) and the cold ischaemia time of all the transplanted organs were evaluated.<h4>Results</h4>During the period 1.1.1998 to 30.6.2009, a total of 408 organ donors were classified as ECD, reflecting 39% of all organ donors in this time period. Despite the fact that all organ donors in this study fulfilled at least one inclusion criterion, the number of recipients with satisfactory primary organ function was always higher than the respective number with a negative primary outcome within the first seven days after transplantation. A longer cold ischaemia time was associated with organs showing insufficient primary organ function compared to organs with satisfactory primary function. A relevant causal relationship cannot be investigated on the basis of our limited data. In addition, a longer observation period would be necessary to draw a more precise conclusion.<h4>Conclusions</h4>ECD as defined by DOPKI and/or age represent a high proportion of all organ donors in Switzerland but show a remarkably good outcome.},

This study evaluates the relevance of hearts and lungs offered by the European Organ Exchange Organisations to Swisstransplant, Switzerland's national organ procurement organisation.<h4>Methods</h4>The study is a retrospective analysis of donor characteristics of 290 hearts and 199 lungs, offered by the European Organ Exchange Organisations between 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2008 to Swisstransplant. It assesses the responses (acceptance/reasons for refusal) from the Swiss heart and lung transplant centres.<h4>Results</h4>Among the 290 hearts offered by the foreign transplant organisations, eight (2.8%) were accepted by a Swiss transplant centre. This corresponds to 5.8% of the Swiss heart transplant activity during the observation period. In the lung group (n = 199), five (2.5%) were accepted, equalling 2.8% of the transplant activity. As for the reasons for refusal, approximately one-fifth and one-sixth of both the heart and lung offers were refused for medical and logistic reasons, respectively. For more than half of the offers, there was either no compatible recipient on the Swiss waiting list, or the reason for refusal was not specified. Notably, 47.6% of the offers in the heart group and 46.7% of the lung offers originated from donors aged less than 16 years.<h4>Conclusions</h4>International organ exchange is a very valuable and effective way to allocate a maximum of medically suitable organs to recipients on the waiting list. Organ exchange is lifesaving, especially in children, and also in patients with rare blood groups. A professional structure within the national organ procurement organisations, and a close cooperation between them on an international level, is crucial to achieve organ exchange on a high-quality level in Europe.},

	Abstract = {<h4>Background</h4>On 1 July 2007 a new transplant law came into force in Switzerland. The principal item of this new law is the change from centre-oriented allocation to patient-oriented national allocation of organs. The aim of the present study is to assess the impact on cold ischaemia time (CIT) and transport requirements.<h4>Methods</h4>From 1 July 2006 to 30 June 2008 168 brain-dead donors were registered by Swisstransplant in Switzerland. Donors have been analysed in a retrospective cohort study design. Donor characteristics, transportation requirements and CIT were assessed from the Necroreport.<h4>Results</h4>74 donors (44%) were allocated in the period before the introduction of the new law (period A) and 94 donors (56%) after the new law. Donor characteristics were similar. In period A, 114 organs (37.9%) were allocated within the procurement centre, compared to 54 organs (15.5%) in period B. Transport time for liver and kidney was remarkably longer in period B. Overall, CITs remained largely stable except for a significant increase of nearly 115 minutes in the liver graft median CIT (p <0.01).<h4>Conclusions</h4>The new Swiss transplant law clearly entails an increase in the frequency of organ transports. Overall CIT is not affected. However, liver transplantation is afflicted by an increase in transports and CIT. This may affect mid-term outcome and should therefore be followed closely.},

	Abstract = {Since 1985 Swisstransplant coordinates all allocations for organ transplantations in Switzerland. During these 20 years the number of deceased donors decreased, while the number of living donors increased. In the same period the number of patients on a waiting list for organ transplantation increased significantly, up to more than 1000 at the end of2004. During the year 2004 412 patients were transplanted, 43 (4%) died while waiting on the list. In comparison to other European countries the frequency of organ donation from deceased donors is relatively low in Switzerland, only 13 per million inhabitants. In order to treat the high number of patients needing organ transplantation, additional efforts have to be undertaken in future. The measures include the development of alternative therapies preventing or treating organ failure, the amelioration of legal conditions of organ transplantation with the new law, an increase of resources and knowledge to improve donor evaluation and donor pools in the donor hospitals, a further improvement of the allocation process, the enhancement of information and motivation of the population by the patient organisations, the medical staff, Swisstransplant and eventually public means.},

	Abstract = {Sensitized patients may reject renal transplants at a tempo or with a force dictated by their previous exposure to alloantigen. The patient's pretransplant alloimmunization status is usually assessed by the measurement of panel reactive antibodies (PRAs) and by the crossmatch. The test results using current patient's sera are of considerable predictive value. In contrast, the relevance of historical sera is much debated. To further investigate the correlation of PRA and crossmatch with clinical outcome, 852 cadaveric kidney transplants were evaluated. As expected, graft survival was significantly longer (p = 0.01;logrank test) in nonimmunized patients (n = 516) compared to immunized patients with more than 10% PRA (n = 297). Patients with persistently positive PRAs (n = 171) were then compared to patients with positive historical but negative current PRAs (n = 126). Interestingly, their graft survival was practically identical. Finally, transplants across a positive historical T cell crossmatch (n = 39) had a significantly reduced graft survival (p = 0.015) compared to transplants in immunized patients (n = 297, all T cell crossmatch negative). Thus, this study confirms the increased risk in sensitized patients and shows that the antigen specific immunological memory is of clinical relevance even if donor specific antibodies are not detectable in current sera.},

	Abstract = {Every year some 200-260 kidney transplants are performed in Switzerland, improving the quality of life of patients with end stage renal disease. The current organ shortage is delaying transplantation of the 400 patients on the waiting list, a situation which calls for optimal utilization of the available donor kidneys. It is well established that AB0-compatibility, negative cytotoxic crossmatch, and optimal immunosuppressive therapy including cyclosporin A are important for a favorable clinical outcome. To identify further factors influencing transplant outcome, we undertook a retrospective study of all 1656 transplants to which the above criteria applied. We defined transplants matched for at least 1A, 1B, and 1DR HLA antigen as the better matched, and the remainder as the less well matched grafts. In patients who were not or only weakly immunized to alloantigens, the 5-year graft survival probability was 0.78 versus 0.69 for the better versus the less well matched transplants (p < 0.005). The strongly immunized patients did not, however, show a significant association between the degree of HLA matching and graft survival, presumably because there were more immunized patients in the HLA matched group. As expected, the patients previously immunized to alloantigens showed significantly reduced graft survival early after transplantation. Positive CMV serology, sex mismatch, and cold ischemia time did not correlate with graft survival. Compared to results obtained in the USA or Germany, the survival time of donor kidneys transplanted in Switzerland was significantly increased. Factors contributing to the good results in Switzerland are discussed. Future goals are reduction of alloimmunization and optimized HLA compatibility.},
