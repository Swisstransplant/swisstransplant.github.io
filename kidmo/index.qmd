## What is KIDMO?

KIDMO is a prediction tool that helps clinicians and patients to see how the combination of donor, transplant and recipient clinical characteristics can affect graft survival after deceased-donor kidney transplantation.

## How was KIDMO developed?

KIDMO was developed by [Swisstransplant](https://www.swisstransplant.org/)---the national organisation for organ donation and transplantation in Switzerland and all the six transplant centers.

The model is based on follow-up data from the Swiss Transplant Cohort Study (STCS) and information from the Swiss Organ Allocation System (SOAS) from over 2,000 kidney recipients transplanted between 2008 and 2021.

## What can KIDMO predict?

It is not possible to predict the exact time of organ loss in the future. However, based on all the high-quality data we collected in Switzerland, we can estimate the risk for graft loss for a specific patient conditional on some clinical characteristics.

In the statistical model, the primary outcome was graft survival calculated from the date of of transplantation to the date of irreversible graft failure by return to dialysis (or retransplantation).

More details about KIDMO can be found in the published [study protocol](https://doi.org/10.1186/s41512-022-00139-5).
