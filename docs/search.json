However, based on all the high-quality data we collected in Switzerland, we can estimate the risk for graft loss for a specific patient conditional on some clinical characteristics.\nIn the statistical model, the primary outcome was graft survival calculated from the date of of transplantation to the date of irreversible graft failure by return to dialysis (or retransplantation).\nMore details about KIDMO can be found in the published study protocol."

    "text": "Interpretation\n\nThe HR (hazard ratio) is the relative hazard compared to the reference recipient.\n\nA HR of 1.40 means that the recipient may have graft loss at 1.4-fold the rate of the baseline recipient which corresponds to a increase of the hazard by 40%\nA HR of 0.70 means that the recipient may have graft loss at 0.7-fold the rate of the baseline recipient which corresponds to a decrease of the hazard by 30%.\n\nThe reference recipient is a recipient with all the clinical predictor variables set to the reference level (donor age: 54; donor history of diabetes: no; donor cause of death: other; etc.). The reference recipient should not be confused with an average recipient.\nThe Scaled HR is the HR scaled by the median HR of all recipients from 2008–2021. It can be interpreted as the relative hazard compared to the median recipient, or more informally, the average recipient.\nThe hazard is the rate of occurrence of graft loss. In other words, it is the probability of graft loss over time at 2, 5 and 10 years."
